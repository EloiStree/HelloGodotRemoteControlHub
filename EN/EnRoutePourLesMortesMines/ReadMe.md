**Welcome!**

I love teaching code through games.
My favorite is *World of Warcraft*.

I’ve done it in:

* Python
* C# in Visual Studio
* Unity3D

I want to teach kids more than just Python, but I don’t want them to start with Unity3D or Unreal.

* Unity3D is going to die because they don’t care about their developers.
* Unreal Engine are sharks that want a monopoly.
* Roblox could be a good solution, but it doesn’t run on Raspberry Pi.

So… since GDScript is close to Python and easy to learn,
let’s try to join the Blender, Krita, Audacity, and Godot philosophy 😅😁.

As a Unity developer with 10+ years of experience, I have a lot to relearn...

My plan is simple: finish the Deadmines in WoW Classic with code.
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/fr/wiki/Les\_Mortemines](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/fr/wiki/Les_Mortemines)

And while I’m learning, I’m going to build a step-by-step “Welcome to Godot through the deathmines”


Maye the code be with us.
