You know nothing about computer ü§ì.

Raspberry Pi is a small computer created by UK to teach to kids what are those computer stuffs.

> üêõ If you are too young to do the following step, you can ask someone else to do it for you.


It cost under 150 euro based on what equipement you want to use.

It will cost you 200euro if like me you want to use a small touchscreen dedicated to Pi5

You are going to need a memory card call SD Card of 32-128 go and and SD Card Reader

I am not sure of the max size of it, but 32 Go is quickly too small.

I did a video on assembly all that:
[To Add later here]


Put the SD in the Pi

Installer pi app

[<img width="1151" height="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96ed0991-8aee-4711-98e6-1fd4d7b692ee" />](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotRemoteControlHub/issues/4)
https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotRemoteControlHub/issues/4
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/install | bash
```
<img width="611" height="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3da330f5-b158-4d83-93c2-87785ad8de88" />


Now let, install what you will need, you can choose form this liste:
https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotRemoteControlHub/issues/5

You want to work in the video game industry with Godot, you can study those tools with blind eyes:


Blender to make 3D
```
sudo apt update full-upgrade
sudo apt install blender -y
```
<img width="912" height="574" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2f26a3-fdfb-4e29-a68f-b4a0a2bcb0d1" />



Git is alreay installed. but better be sure because it is the most useful tool
```
# Update your system
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
# Install Git
sudo apt install git -y
# Verify installation
git --version
# Configure Git (replace with your info)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
# Check configuration
git config --list
```

Python the language that you will need to learn one day.
```

# Update your system
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Python 3 and pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y

# Verify Python installation
python3 --version

# Verify pip installation
pip3 --version
```

As you installed Pi-Apps, you can now asking to install what you need:


Godot ... Obviously
```
~/pi-apps/manage install "Godot"
```

Krita to be able to edit 2D image
``` 
~/pi-apps/manage install "Krita"
```
<img width="908" height="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aae7983-9eb3-403d-a59e-54ae4ba0a758" />


Audacity to edit sound and music
``` 
~/pi-apps/manage install "Audacity"
```
<img width="910" height="561" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05cd7e11-f443-40c8-9f8a-9a274d6d7591" />


Visual Studio Code is a text editor easy to use when you code.
(It can be used with Copilote to help you code.)
``` 
~/pi-apps/manage install "Visual Studio Code"
``` 
<img width="912" height="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf5eb1f9-8932-44e8-95b6-abf3791eb19b" />

They are some epic apps you can also install on the Pi.
But those are the minimum to use.


If you want to remote control your raspberry pi to work from a distance, you can use Raspberry Pi Connect
