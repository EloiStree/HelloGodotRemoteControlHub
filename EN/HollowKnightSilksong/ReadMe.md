I was working on *World of Warcraft: Road to the Deadmines* when [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong) suddenly appeared on the store.

So let’s dive into it!

To get started, you’ll need a Raspberry Pi with Godot installed:
[Step: Install Raspberry Pi with Godot](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotRemoteControlHub/blob/main/EN/EnRoutePourLesMortesMines/Day001/Step_InstallRaspberryPiWithGodot.md)

It’s the perfect setup for me to learn Godot while also having fun practicing GDScript through a game.


-------------------------

Ok, no idea where I am going.

First we need to install Silksong on Mini Window.

Be ban of a game can means be ban of Steam...  
⚠️ Buy the game on an alternative account.  

Now we can use an Arduino Leonardo to interface on the Mini PC.
But as my code is not ready and Silksong is here⌛.

I am going to use what works today, XOMI:

I did a french video on how to install it and use it here:

Meaning that I can send by the WiFi of what we call UDP message.

Some small boxes containing stuff like this 10101001110101010101010101111101010101010.
If you use 32 bit 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 that what we call an integer.
A number between -2147483647 and 2147483647 .

That what we call, count in binary
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
0100 = 4
0101 = 5

When you store from right to left it is call big endien
and left to right little endien.

Here is an example for both:
[Add example here for 2501]


What we want to do it press the jump buttons in the game then release.

To make it easy in my adventure, I decided to associate a number to an action for keyboard and for gamepad.
So if you look at my grammar, Scratch To Warcraft: 
https://github.com/EloiStree/2024_08_29_ScratchToWarcraft?tab=readme-ov-file#xbox-xinput-version

You can see that A is 1300 to press and 2300 to release.
