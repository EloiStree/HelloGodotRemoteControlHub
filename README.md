## Hello Godot Remote Control Hub

Learn to code by creating your own controllers with Godot on Raspberry Pi  
*(This guide will later be translated into a shorter version in French for kids’ workshops in Belgium.)*

My name is Eloi and I am a Unity3D developer.
I have tried teaching code:

* on Scratch, but it is too far from practical use.
* on Unity3D, but it quickly becomes too complex for kids.
* on Python and C#, but that soon requires explaining threads to beginners...

I think there is a solution: **Godot.**

* Easier to use than Unity3D
* GDScript is very close to Python
* You can create UIs and read controllers very easily
* It is fully open-source
* It runs on Raspberry Pi
* It works the same on all platforms

I don’t plan to learn Godot for making games, since I already use Unity3D.
My goal with this project is to turn Godot into a nice **remote controller interface on Raspberry Pi**, so kids can learn coding by playing games.

So if you’re interested in learning to code and want to learn Godot,
this repository might be useful for you.

## On the Road to the Deadmines

“Road to the Deadmines” is the kind of fun challenge I enjoy.
I create 4 champions in **World of Warcraft Hardcore Classic**,
and to learn coding, students need to help them level up and finish the **Deadmines** without dying.

### Where I use what I’m teaching here:

* [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/fr-fr/)

  * Challenge: Finish the Deadmines
* [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=fr)

  * Challenge: Building speedrun
