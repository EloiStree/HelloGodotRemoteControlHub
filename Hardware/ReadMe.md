To make this work in real life, I have bought some hardware to run a workshop.

**HC-05 and TTL** to connect via UART the simulated controller and the Godot Engine:

**12 Arduino Leonardo** to make simulated Xbox controllers:

**12 ESP32** to make simulated BLE keyboards, mice, and gamepads:

**12 webcams** to teach about webcam telemetry from color:

**12 MiraBox** to hack HDMI screens and generate telemetry from color without software on the device:

**12 IR transmitters and receivers** because you want to learn how to remote-control IoT devices and listen to TV remotes to trigger your macros:

**12 motor controllers**, because if you have 12 Arduino and ESP32 boards, why not have a bit of fun with them:
